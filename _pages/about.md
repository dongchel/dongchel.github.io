I am a second-year PhD candidate at MIT, advised by [Prof. Vivishek Sudhir](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=j4NKNWQAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao). My research interest is `quantum precision measurements` to explore the gap between quantum physics and gravity. Specifically, we use light to measure and control macroscopic mechanical oscillators toward the realization of tangible quantum test masses. These works will not only shed light on fundamental physics but also pave the way for future quantum applications such as quantum sensing and quantum metrology.

Before coming to MIT, I received B.S. and M.S. degrees in Mechanical Engineering from Tokyo Institute of Technology and the University of Tokyo, respectively. Then, I worked at KAIST in Korea as a research associate (with military duty), advised by [Prof. Seung-Woo Kim](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=wHt0GtQAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao) and [Prof. Young-Jin Kim](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=DqkYhz4AAAAJ&hl=en_). There, I carried out experiments on `frequency combs`, `time/frequency standards`, and `precision measurements`.
